Untar the simpletest.tgz file.  The 'simpletest' directory should be parallel 
with the 'all.php' file.

Run all.php.  This will run in text mode if run from the command line, 
or in HTML mode if the php_sapi_name is not 'cli' (any web server, 
for example).

all.php will include all test_*.php files, and assume that 
the class name of each one is Test???.  

Examples
========
test_system.php -> class TestSystem
test_foo.php 	-> class TestFoo
