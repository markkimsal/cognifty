	<h4>Module / Service / Events</h4>
	<p>
	Cognifty is segmented into a 3-tier system of code.  The current style-du-jour of MVC is a bit overused in the Web world.  
	MVC is a pattern for graphical user interfaces, not for application architecture.  
	</p><p>
	<b>MSE</b> is a structured layout of business logic so that any portion of code is easily found by any member of a development team.  By assigning specialized diretory, file, and class layout, much work can be eliminated because the framework follows standard naming conventions.
	</p><p>
	A <em>Module</em> is, literally, a directory.  It can be an entire Web application or a well defined portion of an entire Web application.
	</p><p>
	A <em>Service</em> is a special class inside a module.  Services provide all the business logic of your application.  A service can have special templating and authorization hooks, different from other parts of your Web application.
	</p><p>
	An <em>Event</em> is a single instance of a client request. Events are methods of your service class.  Events take <em>SystemRequest</em> objects as input and <em>template</em> arrays for output.
	</p>


	<a name="tpl"></a>
	<h4>Templating</h4>
	<p>
	Templating can be thought of as the output phase of your application.  All output from a service is named in an output array.  This array is then passed to the templating system, which can be configured to suit your needs.
	</p><p>
	The default templating system is designed to pull in one single template file and put the current MSE's output into the main content area.  
	Other content areas use the <em>Layout</em> system to gather their needed output.
	</p><p>

	</p>


	<a name="lay"></a>
	<h4>Layout</h4>
	<p>
	The layout system is built around named areas of your template.
	Each area is defined in the layout.ini file and is given a specific path, file, class name, object name, and method call.
	The template designer then simply places a call to the layout engine and passes in the named area, example:  <b>box.side1</b>.
	The layout system then finds the configured object method call for <b>box.side1</b>, calls the method, and passes back the complete output.
	</p><p>

	</p>


	<a name="obj"></a>
	<h4>Object Store</h4>
	<p>
	The entire system configuration is held in the <em>Object store</em>.  The object store eliminates the need for <b>globals</b>.
	
	</p><p>
	The object store is essential to customizing a developed Web application.  With it, you can insert your own sub-classes throught the system without changing any code!
	You simply need to reconfigure core components in the supplied ini files, giving your new sub-classes and the system will automatically use them system-wide.
